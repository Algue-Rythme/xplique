The goal of this library is to gather the state of the art of Explainable AI to help you understand your complex neural network models. Explore Xplique docs \u00bb Attributions \u00b7 Concept \u00b7 Feature Visualization \u00b7 Metrics The library is composed of several modules, the Attributions Methods module implements various methods (e.g Saliency, Grad-CAM, Integrated-Gradients...), with explanations, examples and links to official papers. The Feature Visualization module allows to see how neural networks build their understanding of images by finding inputs that maximize neurons, channels, layers or compositions of these elements. The Concepts module allows you to extract human concepts from a model and to test their usefulness with respect to a class. Finally, the Metrics module covers the current metrics used in explainability. Used in conjunction with the Attribution Methods module, it allows you to test the different methods or evaluate the explanations of a model. \ud83d\udcda Table of contents \u00b6 \ud83d\udcda Table of contents \ud83d\udd25 Tutorials \ud83d\ude80 Quick Start \ud83d\udce6 What's Included \ud83d\udcde Callable \ud83d\udc4d Contributing \ud83d\udc40 See Also \ud83d\ude4f Acknowledgments \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf93 Creator \ud83d\uddde\ufe0f Citation \ud83d\udcdd License \ud83d\udd25 Tutorials \u00b6 We propose some Hands-on tutorials to get familiar with the library and its api: Attribution Methods : Getting started Attribution Methods : Sanity checks paper Attribution Methods : Tabular data and Regression Attribution Methods : Metrics Concepts Methods : Testing with Concept Activation Vectors Feature Visualization : Getting started You can find a certain number of other practical tutorials just here .

Installation can be done using Pypi: pip install xplique Now that Xplique is installed, here are 4 basic examples of what you can do with the available modules. Attributions Methods \u00b6 let's start with a simple example, by computing Grad-CAM for several images (or a complete dataset) on a trained model. from xplique.attributions import GradCAM # load images, labels and model # ... explainer = GradCAM ( model ) explanations = explainer . explain ( images , labels ) # or just `explainer(images, labels)` All attributions methods share a common API. You can find out more about it here . Attributions Metrics \u00b6 In order to measure if the explanations provided by our method are faithful (it reflects well the functioning of the model) we can use a fidelity metric such as Deletion from xplique.attributions import GradCAM from xplique.metrics import Deletion # load images, labels and model # ... explainer = GradCAM ( model ) explanations = explainer ( inputs , labels ) metric = Deletion ( model , inputs , labels ) score_grad_cam = metric ( explanations ) All attributions metrics share a common API. You can find out more about it here Concepts Extraction \u00b6 Concerning the concept-based methods, we can for example extract a concept vector from a layer of a model. In order to do this, we use two datasets, one containing inputs containing the concept: positive_samples , the other containing other entries which do not contain the concept: negative_samples . from xplique.concepts import Cav # load a model, samples that contain a concept # (positive) and samples who don't (negative) # ... extractor = Cav ( model , 'mixed3' ) concept_vector = extractor ( positive_samples , negative_samples ) More information on CAV here and on TCAV here . Feature Visualization \u00b6 Finally, in order to find an image that maximizes a neuron and at the same time a layer, we build two objectives that we combine together. We then call the optimizer which returns our images from xplique.features_visualizations import Objective from xplique.features_visualizations import optimize # load a model... neuron_obj = Objective . neuron ( model , \"logits\" , 200 ) channel_obj = Objective . layer ( model , \"mixed3\" , 10 ) obj = neuron_obj + 2.0 * channel_obj images , obj_names = optimize ( obj ) Want to know more ?

This metric computes the capacity of the model to make predictions while only the most important features are not perturbed 1 . Score interpretation \u00b6 The interpretation of the score depends on the score metric you are using to evaluate your model. - For metrics where the score increases with the performance of the model (such as accuracy). If explanations are accurate, the score will quickly rise to the score on non-perturbed input. Thus, in this case, a higher score represent a more accurate explanation. For metrics where the score decreases with the performance of the model (such as losses). If explanations are accurate, the score will quickly fall to the score on non-perturbed input.

For instance, with Computer Vision (CV) tasks, the main goal is to underline the pixels contributing the most in the input image(s) leading to the model\u2019s output(s). Common API \u00b6 All attribution methods inherit from the Base class BlackBoxExplainer . This base class can be initialized with two parameters: model : the model from which we want to obtain attributions (e.g: InceptionV3, ResNet, ...) batch_size : an integer which allows to either process inputs per batch (gradient-based methods) or process perturbed samples of an input per batch (inputs are therefore process one by one) In addition, all class inheriting from BlackBoxExplainer should implement an explain method: @abstractmethod def explain ( self , inputs : Union [ tf . data .

You will need to define a custom map_to_interpret_space when building such interpreters. Warning If your model is not following the same conventions it might lead to poor results. On the bright side, there is only need for your model to be called on inputs with such shape. Therefore, you can overcome this by writing a wrapper around your model. For example, imagine you have a trained model which takes images with channel first ( i.e \\(inputs.shape=(N, C, W, H)\\) ). However, we saw that an explainer need images inputs with \\((N, W, H, C)\\) shape. Then, we can wrap the original model and redefine its call function so that it swaps inputs axes before proceding to the original call: class TemplateModelWrapper ( nn . Module ): def __init__ ( self , ncwh_model ): super ( TemplateModelWrapper , self ) . __init__ () self . model = ncwh_model def __call__ ( self , nwhc_inputs ): # transform your NWHC inputs to NCWH inputs nchw_inputs = self . _transform_inputs ( nwhc_inputs ) # make predictions outputs = self . ncwh_model ( nchw_inputs ) return outputs def _transform_inputs ( self , nwhc_inputs ): # include in this function all transformation # needed for your model to work with NWHC inputs # , here for example we swap from channels last # to channels first ncwh_inputs = tf . transpose ( nwhc_inputs , [ 0 , 3 , 1 , 2 ]) return ncwh_inputs wrapped_model = TemplateModelWrapper ( model ) explainer = Saliency ( wrapped_model ) # images should be (N, W, H, C) for the explain call explanations = explainer . explain ( images , labels ) Warning In any case, when you are out of the scope of the original API, you should take a deep look at the source code to be sure that your Use Case will make sense. targets : Must be one of the following: a tf.Tensor or a np.ndarray . Info targets should be a one hot encoding of the output you want an explanation of! - Therefore, targets's shape must match: \\((N, outputs\\_size)\\) - \\(N\\) is the number of inputs - \\(outputs\\_size\\) is the number of outputs - For a classification task, the \\(1\\) value should be on the class of interest's (and only this one) index on the outputs. For example, I have three classes ('dogs, 'cats', 'fish') and a classifier with three outputs (the probability to belong to each class). I have an image of a fish and I want to know why my model think it is a fish. Then, the corresponding target of my image will be \\([0, 0, 1]\\) Warning Sometimes the explanation might be non-sense. One possible reason is that your model did not predict at all the output you asked an explanation for. For example, in the previous configuration, the model might have predicted a cat on your fish image. Therefore, you might want to see why it made such a prediction and use \\([0, 1, 0]\\) as target. Tip If you replace \\(1\\) by \\(-1\\) you can also see what goes against an output prediction! - For a regression task, you might have only one output then one target will be the vector \\([1]\\) (and not the regression value!) Even though we made an harmonized API for all attributions methods it might be relevant for the user to distinguish Gradient based and Perturbation based methods, also often referenced respectively as white-box and black-box methods, as their hyperparameters settings might be quite different. Perturbation-based approaches \u00b6 Perturbation based methods focus on perturbing an input with a variety of techniques and, with the analysis of the resulting outputs, define an attribution representation. Therefore, there is no need to explicitly know the model architecture as long as forward pass is available, which explain why they are also referenced as black-box methods. Therefore, to use perturbation-based approaches you do not need a TF model. To know more, please see the Callable documentation. Xplique includes the following black-box attributions: Method Name Tutorial KernelShap Lime Occlusion Rise Gradient-based approaches \u00b6 Those approaches are also called white-box methods as they require a full access to the model architecture , notably it should allow computing gradients with TensorFlow (for Xplique, in general any automatic differentiation framework would work). Indeed, the core idea with the gradient-based approach is to use back-propagation, along other techniques, not to update the model\u2019s weights (which is already trained) but to reveal the most contributing inputs, potentially in a specific layer.
